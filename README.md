planer_finder (aka:Layover)
=============

My second and third project helping travelers unite during delayed times!

Have you ever flown somewhere and been stuck on a delayed flight just because? RIGHT! This happens more often than not!
I love to travel and this was a main problem for me and I'm often bored at the airport with nothing to do. I don't have my laptop 
on me most of the time so what's a girl to do?

Introducing Layover...

The premise is to connect delayed travelers at the airport for business ideas, pass the time, networking, etc...
I created this app utilizing Python/Django for the backend work, FlightStats API for the exact delayed times, and AngularJS(FireBase)
for the real time chat functionality between users in the database! 



=============
•	User Sign Up
•	User Sign In
•	User input flight name, number, time/date
•	User gets notification of the exact delayed minutes of the flight and steps to do next
•	User gets to choose from “coffee”, “business”, “networking opportunities”
•	User gets taken to page with profiles of other users in the DB who chose same options
•	User can directly message them via chat
•	Website is currently mobile friendly
