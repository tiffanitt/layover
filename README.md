planer_finder (aka:Layover)
=============

My second and third project helping travelers unite during delayed times!

Have you ever flown somewhere and been stuck on a delayed flight just because? RIGHT! This happens more often than not!
Everyone travels and delays are inevitable, so what is one going to do to fill the time without leaving the airport?

Introducing Layover...

The premise is to connect delayed travelers at the airport for business ideas, pass the time, networking, etc...
I created this app utilizing Python/Django for the backend work, FlightStats API for the exact delayed times, and AngularJS(FireBase)
for the real time chat functionality between users in the database! 



=============
•	User Sign Up

•	User Sign In

•	User input flight name, number, time/date

•	User gets notification of the exact delayed minutes of the flight and steps to do next

•	User gets to choose from “coffee”, “business”, “networking opportunities”

•	User gets taken to page with profiles of other users in the DB who chose same options

•	User can directly message them via chat

•	Website is currently mobile friendly
